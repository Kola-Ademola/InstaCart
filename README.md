## INTRODUCTION
___
Instacart is an American delivery company that operates a grocery delivery and pick-up service in the United States and Canada. The company offers its services via a website and mobile app. The service allows customers to order groceries from participating retailers with the shopping being done by a personal shopper. This project is just focused on **DENORMALIZATION** of the Instacart orders dataset & some basic analysis
___
## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
I used advanced SQL functions to import the dataset and normalized it, then I did some basic data analysis to query the database as well, all in PostgreSQL.  

### DENORMALIZATION PROCESS
For this project I started by creating a temporary table to hold the denormalized data first;

Then I imported the data from the **csv** into the temporary table I created.

After importing the data I split it into 4 tables to acheive **3NF**

## DATA MODELLING
___
The initial dataset is a denormalized dataset; I will be denormalizing it to **3NF** brfore analysis  
___DENORMALIZED DATASET___  
![](images/denormalized_data.png)
* The whole order details is in one table, I will break it down to 4 diffrent tables in the process of normalization or archieving **3NF**.   
* The result of normalization can be seen in this data model(**STAR SCHEMA**);

## DATA ANALYSIS & VISUALIZATIONS
____
I'll be using this database to solve some business problems that the owner of **Instacart** is interested in knowing and solving..

### BUSINESS PROBLEMS
* Q1 What are the top-selling products by revenue, and how much revenue have they generated?

___RESULT___  
![](images/q2_table.png)
> INSIGHT:::The top products with the most generated profit all have the same profit margin, with **"Vanilla, Tangerine & Shortbread Ice Cream"** at the top of list with **"$1,118.40"** total profit.
___
* Q3 Which aisles have the highest sales volume, and how does this vary by department?  
___QUERY___  
![](images/q3.png)
___RESULT___  
![](images/q3_table.png)
> INSIGHT:::The **"missing"** aisle has the highest overall sales volume with over **147,000** items sold
___
* Q4 What is the average order size (in terms of quantity and total cost) per day of the week?  
___QUERY___  
![](images/q4.png)
___RESULT___  
![](images/q4_table.png)
> INSIGHT:::The average order size & value is almost the same for most days of the week, but **Fridays** come out on top with **"6 orders per day"** and an AOV of **"$151.36"**.
___
* Q5 Which products are most commonly purchased together, and what is the frequency of these combinations?  
___QUERY___  
![](images/q5.png)
___RESULT___  
![](images/q5_table.png)
> INSIGHT:::Surprisingly most orders are made in the middle of the night, with **3AM** having the most orders.
___
* Q6 What is the average time between orders for each user, and how does this vary by product category?  
___QUERY___  
![](images/q6.png)
___RESULT___  
![](images/q6_table.png)
> INSIGHT::: Only **22%** of the orders placed have been delivered to the customers.

## RECCOMMENDATIONS & CONCLUSIONS
* Since the **"Vanilla, Tangerine & Shortbread Ice Cream"** is the top-selling product with high revenue, InstaCart can consider promoting it further to maximize sales by offering special deals or discounts to attract more customers.

* InstaCart should identify other products with a similar profit margin(**high profit-margin**) as the top-selling product and prioritize them in their marketing and sales efforts. These products have the potential to generate significant profit, so allocating resources to promote sales would be a very good move.

* The **"missing"** aisle has the highest overall sales volume, indicating its popularity among customers. Investigation should be carried out to find out why this aisle is labeled as **"missing"** and ensure its correct categorization to maintain its sales momentum. Consider expanding the product range in this aisle to meet customer demand and further drive sales upward.

* Since **Fridays** have the highest average order size and value, InstaCart should take this as an opportunity to run targeted marketing campaigns, offering exclusive deals, or offers on Fridays. This can attract more customers and boost sales during this peak day.

* For the fact that most orders are placed in the middle of the night, particularly at **3AM**, Instacart should ensure that operations, including customer support and order fulfillment, are optimized to handle the influx of orders during this time of the day.

* With only 22% of orders delivered, which is very poor there is a need to investigate and address delivery challenges if any by evaluating the existing delivery processes, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing improvements to enhance delivery efficiency. Instacart can also focus on reducing delivery times, ensuring proper packaging, and providing real-time tracking updates to enhance the overall customer experience.
