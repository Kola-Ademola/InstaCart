## INTRODUCTION
___
Instacart is an American delivery company that operates a grocery delivery and pick-up service in the United States and Canada. The company offers its services via a website and mobile app. The service allows customers to order groceries from participating retailers with the shopping being done by a personal shopper. This project is just focused on **DENORMALIZATION** of the Instacart orders dataset & some basic analysis
___
## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
I used advanced SQL functions to import the dataset and normalized it, then I did some basic data analysis to query the database as well, all in PostgreSQL.  

### DENORMALIZATION PROCESS
For this project I started by creating a temporary table to hold the denormalized data first;

Then I imported the data from the **csv** into the temporary table I created.

___RESULT___

After importing the data I split it into 4 tables to acheive **3NF**

## DATA MODELLING
___
The initial dataset is a denormalized dataset; I will be denormalizing it to **3NF** brfore analysis  
___DENORMALIZED DATASET___  
![](images/denormalized_data.png)
* The whole order details is in one table, I will break it down to 4 diffrent tables in the process of normalization or archieving **3NF**.   
* The result of normalization can be seen in this data model(**STAR SCHEMA**);
